## README for "Getting and Cleaning Data" class project


**Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:**

1. Download the zip file from [this URL](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
2. Unzip the file.
3. Move ALL of the following files to the SAME DIRECTORY as the R script:
	* `features.txt`
	* `subject_train.txt`
	* `subject_test.txt`
	* `X_test.txt`
	* `y_test.txt`
	* `X_train.txt`
	* `y_train.txt`


**Once those steps are complete, you can run the R script ([run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R)).
** Note that it requires the 'reshape2' package

**The output of the R script is a tidy data set, [tidy.csv](tidy.csv).**
