Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:03,840
I just want to introduce a experimental
feature that

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,680
we've, that we've developed for the R
programming class.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,570
It's called Statistics with Interactive R
Learning or SWIRL for short.

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,650
And it's, and it was developed by Nick
Carchedi, who's

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,930
a student here at the Johns Hopkins
department of bio-statistics.

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,620
This is a system that allows you to kind
of interactively learn R at your own pace.

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,900
And it will walk you through a, a bunch of
lessons about different

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,510
aspects of the R language and you can kind
of practice as you go.

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,122
So, rather than kind of watching a lecture
and then,

11
00:00:31,122 --> 00:00:33,170
you know, doing an assignment and kind of
doing things

12
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,020
piece by piece, you can actually work on R
right

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,940
in the R console in, in a kind of guided
way.

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,660
Rather than kind of just figuring things
out on your own.

15
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,260
So, I think this, the SWIRL modules are
really helpful

16
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,850
and I encourage you to try to walk through
them.

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,400
If you decide to complete them you'll get
you'll

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,410
get a little extra credit through the
programming assignment.

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,680
But the, the modules are absolutely not
required.

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,960
They are totally optional.

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,590
And so, you don't have to worry about
doing them.

22
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,410
You can still do perfectly well in the
class without doing the SWIRL modules.

23
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,060
Nevertheless, I encourage you to try it
out.

24
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,100
I think it'll be a lot of fun.
