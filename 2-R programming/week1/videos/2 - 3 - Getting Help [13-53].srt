1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,680
This video is about how to get help when
learning to use R and taking this course.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,100
Because of the, because of the size of the
course and the number of students that are

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,550
enrolled it's going to be difficult to
have, to

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,350
be asking lots of questions on a
one-to-one basis.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,190
And so we're going to have to resort to a
few other tools to get questions answered.

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,190
In particular, the discussion boards and
generally through e-mail.

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,340
And so, there's a certain type of way to

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,130
ask questions that will kind of, that will
hope

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,410
to maximize the chance of you getting the

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,150
right answer or the answer that you're
looking for.

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,410
And so at, the main thing to remember is
that asking questions

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,710
via email is, is a little bit different
from asking questions in person.

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,740
You don't necessarily know that the people
on the other

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,210
side, the people that you're asking, for
example, on the discussion

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,750
board or on a mailing list, have, you
don't necessarily

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,560
know that they have the same background
information that you have.

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,440
furthermore, they may not know you
personally, and so may not know your

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,796
kind of, what you mean when you say
certain types of things.

19
00:00:54,796 --> 00:00:57,550
so, that's kind of important to keep in
mind when you are

20
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,160
e-mailing questions as opposed to when
you're talking to someone in person.

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,060
Keep in mind of course that elder people
are very

22
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,300
busy and their time is limited and
although may be willing

23
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,040
to help you by answering a question, they
may have only

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,730
a certain amount of time to devote to
answering that question.

25
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,460
Now, I am here of course to, a the
Instructor, to help you in

26
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,860
all circumstances but furthermore, I may
not

27
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,020
be able to answer all possible questions.

28
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,920
And so you want to, you're going to
want to, use the

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,910
resource that you have available to you in
this course.

30
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,680
So in your search for answers there are a
variety of things that you

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,650
can do on your own before venturing off to
other people for the answer.

32
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,430
So if you are going to be emailing a
question to a forum or

33
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,390
to a mailing list, it's importnat that you
search the archives of that forum for

34
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:42,880
the answer.

35
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,750
So, it's possible, and depending on the
size of the forum, almost

36
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,850
very likely that that someone has asked
the same question that you're asking.

37
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,520
And if someone else has asked that
question and it has been

38
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,070
answered then the answers giong to be in
the archives for that forum.

39
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,480
So if the answer's already there you save
everyone a lot of time, including

40
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,040
yourself, if you search the archives for
that forum and just find the answer.

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,760
Of course the web is very large and has
many answers and your first reaction

42
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,480
when you have a question is to search the
web.

43
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,060
for, given the type of program you're
using, for example, here we're using R,

44
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,140
there are many manuals that are available
and many answers may exists in the manual.

45
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,100
There's a frequently asked question, a FAQ
that's

46
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,310
on the R website that you can look for,

47
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,810
that contains many questions that are
commonly, come up

48
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,760
up on the mailing lists and on the forums.

49
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,913
Another thing that you might want to try
to do before you go venturing out

50
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:37,200
to ask people the, for the answers, is to
play around with the problem and

51
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,060
try to find the answer by inspecting or
experiment, experimentation.

52
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,660
So maybe if you have a function that's not
working right, maybe change the

53
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,240
inputs and see, see if the outputs change,
or if the error message changes.

54
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,400
if, if you're lucky enough to have a
skilled friend

55
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,960
who knows something about R, you can ask
them personally.

56
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,910
And it will be easier to, it's usually
easier to ask a person on

57
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,870
a one-to-one basis than to email a group
of people in a, in a forum.

58
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,950
furthermore, then lastly, if you're a
programmer you

59
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,500
may be able to find the answers you're
looking for by reading the source code.

60
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,660
So, all of the things on the previous
slide are, are useful

61
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,860
things to do on your own before venturing
out to ask people questions.

62
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,030
However, if you don't find the answer
it's, it's important to let other

63
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,370
people know that you did all those other
things on the previous slide.

64
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,460
Because if, for example, the answer is in
the

65
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,490
documentation, for the program, for
example, it's in one of

66
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,840
the R manuals then someone who knows the
answer

67
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,070
will usually respond by saying, read the
documentation or read

68
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,600
the manual.

69
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,500
Ad then you've just wasted one round of
email because they'll have to

70
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,710
respond saying I did read the manual and I
didn't find the answer there.

71
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,510
And so if you, letting people know that

72
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,760
you've done all, you've done your homework
and you've,

73
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,170
you've looked in a variety of places, is
very useful and it saves a lot of time.

74
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,340
So here's a just a very simple example of
what might happen as you're using R.

75
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,670
So here I'm loading the data sets package.

76
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,290
And then I'm going to load the air quality
data set

77
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,540
from that package.

78
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,500
And then I'm going to want to run the

79
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,280
correlation function on this air quality
data frame.

80
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,170
So immediately I get an error.

81
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:10,395
It says error in core, air quality missing
observations in cov slash cor.

82
00:04:10,395 --> 00:04:12,360
So you might be wondering well why am I
getting this error?

83
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:12,980
What does it mean?

84
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,400
So the first thing you can do is go to
Google.

85
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,100
And in many circumstances Google is going
to be your friend.

86
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,010
And this is no different when you are
learning

87
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,470
a new programming language or when you are
learning R.

88
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,180
And so the easiest thing to do is, is to
take the error message

89
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,590
that you get and literally cut and paste
it into the search box for Google.

90
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,350
When I search on that I get a number

91
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,640
of results, and particularly this third
result looks very promising.

92
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,710
It looks like someone asked this question
on the R help mailing list and it looks

93
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,200
like and so maybe, maybe we're clicking
that

94
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,830
to see, if someone replied with the
answer.

95
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,240
So, when you ask a question on a mailing
list, so assuming that

96
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,930
Google wasn't able to help you out you're
going, if you're going to ask

97
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,590
a question on a discussion board or on the
mailing list, there are

98
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,840
a couple of things you need to think about
before you ask that question.

99
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,840
First, is it possible to reproduce your
problem?

100
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,910
So, is it, so when, if someone else can
reproduce your problem, it makes it

101
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,460
a lot easier for that other person

102
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,210
to figure out what the solution's going to
be.

103
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,280
And so if you can provide some

104
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,820
code or some very simple example that will
reproduce your

105
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,250
problem, this will be enormously useful to
everyone else involved.

106
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,420
And if you don't do this typically the
first response

107
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,440
you get will be can you please provide a
reproducable example.

108
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,720
Second it's important to understand what
you

109
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,130
expect the output to be, because if your

110
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:42,500
expectation is wrong, then of course your,
it may or may not be an error depending

111
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,130
on what your expectation should be.

112
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,900
So what you expect the output to be will
indicate kind of how,

113
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,120
what the nature of the error and what
needs to be solved.

114
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,400
And then, given your expectation, you'd to
say, what do you see instead?

115
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,760
So what was the thing that was unexpected
that gave you the question?

116
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,920
Other information that's important to
specify when you're asking

117
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,050
a question, is the version of the product
you're using.

118
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,920
For example what version of R are you
using?

119
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,620
What version of the R

120
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,750
packages are you using, if it's specific
to a given package?

121
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,140
Because often there may be legitimate bugs
and versions and older versions of R or R

122
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,560
packages and that the your problem might
be

123
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,020
solvable if you just upgrade to the latest
version.

124
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,760
So, if you're using the latest version of
R it's important to mention that.

125
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,460
Sometimes it's important to know what

126
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,910
operating system you're using, so whether
you're

127
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,980
using a Mac or Windows or Linux or some
other Unix machines, it.

128
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,820
Some problems can be traced

129
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,550
to the type of operating system that
you're using.

130
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,300
And depending on the question that you
have, there

131
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,410
may be additional information that you
need to provide.

132
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,520
So, when you send an email to a forum or
to a discussion board.

133
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,240
It's important to get as much information
in

134
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,290
there, as much useful information in there
as possible.

135
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,820
And, this includes the subject line for
the email.

136
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:58,030
So there's a couple of examples of subject
lines that kind of range in usefulness.

137
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:02,590
So, that is probably the least useful,
just says, help, can't fit linear model.

138
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,990
So, here there's, there's very little
information here.

139
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,660
All I know is that there's something,
there's some problem

140
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,146
with linear models I don't know anything
else about what the user's problem is.

141
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:14,080
So the second version is is, is much
better.

142
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,490
Eh, it tells me that on R version 2.15.0
the lm() function produces

143
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,360
the seg fault which meaning that R
crashes, with a large data frame.

144
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,760
And it furthermore says I'm using Mac OS
10 10, 10.6.3.

145
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,020
So here I've got the operating system, the

146
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,700
version of the operating system, I've got
the

147
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,700
version of R, I've got what function I'm
using,

148
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,120
and I've got a summary of what actually
happened.

149
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,310
So, just a little bit smarter than that
would, would just be to

150
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:46,120
reformat the message so that I specify
what version I'm using the function and

151
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,930
then the version of the operating system
and then, and then, so that

152
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,540
gives me the context and after that I can
say what the problem was.

153
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,270
In this case it was the seg fault on a
large data frame.

154
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,050
So, here the

155
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,840
important details are right away put into
the subject header

156
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,180
before I even get to the body of the
message.

157
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,400
So, a couple of things that you definitely
want to do when you're asking a question

158
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,730
on a forum or a mailing list first is to
describe the goal, not the step.

159
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,880
So, you may have many, many steps that
you're going

160
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,180
through and maybe one of those steps is
causing a problem.

161
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,570
And it's useful for other people to know
what your big, what

162
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,380
the bigger picture is in terms of what
you're trying to do

163
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,410
because, for example, they might have a
better idea about how to

164
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,830
go about achieving that goal, which may be
faster or simpler and

165
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,290
may work around whatever problem you're
having.

166
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,930
So describe the ultimate goal and then
talk about what the problems are.

167
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,030
And don't just narrow it down to the, to

168
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,840
the one little step that you're having a
problem with.

169
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,500
Be explicit about your questions, so
remember,

170
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,414
provide details about what you're trying
to do.

171
00:08:49,414 --> 00:08:52,920
And you have to provide the minimum amount
of information necessary.

172
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,870
So not the maximum amount of information,
the minimum amount of information.

173
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,220
And so it's common

174
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,290
to see see on some mailing list posts

175
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,180
that, you know, lots of outputters
produce, and

176
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,790
that's not very helpful, because volume
doesn't really

177
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,310
help you in terms of diagnosing the
problem.

178
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,110
We need to know exactly, to narrow down
kind of where the problem is going to be.

179
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,390
So, and of course, a couple things, you
know, being courteous never hurts anyone.

180
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,570
And it and promoting civility on mailing
lists is always a nice thing.

181
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,390
And if you find the solution later on,
it's useful for everyone

182
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,730
else in the community if you follow up
with the solution and explain

183
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,860
what the problem was, what the problem was
and how you solved it.

184
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,450
A couple things you definitely do not want
to do when posting to a forum.

185
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,820
You don't want to claim that you found a
bug.

186
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,790
This happens all the time and usually, I'd
say 99 times out of 100, it's not a bug

187
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,492
and it's just a misunderstanding about
what should have

188
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:48,260
happened, so a mistake in the expectation
of the user.

189
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,580
Groveling as a substitute for doing your
homework, that's not

190
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,340
usually looked well upon and you
definitely shouldn't do that.

191
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,140
Definitely don't want to

192
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,430
post homework questions on a mailing list
or forums and,

193
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,240
and the reason is because people who write
the homeworks,

194
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,890
the homework questions are reading those
mailing lists and would

195
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,240
be able to identify all homework questions
without a doubt.

196
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,010
So we've seen them all, don't bother
trying to

197
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,510
get the answers to your homework on
mailing lists.

198
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,380
Don't ever email multiple mailing lists at
once.

199
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,990
So this is little bit annoying, because,
people will be

200
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,640
subscribed to different mailing lists and
will be getting your message

201
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,330
more then one time.

202
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,790
It's useful to, it's important to figure

203
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,420
out which mailing list is the most
appropriate

204
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,510
mailing list for your question and then
send

205
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,560
the message to that mailing list or forum.

206
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,110
And then lastly, don't ask others to debug
your code without

207
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,600
giving some sort of hint as to what the
problem might be.

208
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,240
So it's, it's very difficult when a person
posts a long listing of code

209
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,830
and says, there is a problem in

210
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,460
here somewhere, I don't know where, please
help.

211
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:46,840
It's better

212
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,260
to give to kind of specify where you think
the problem is

213
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,530
and what you're trying to do so that
everyone can save some time.

214
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,160
So this is just the very brief case study

215
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,967
on using a recent post to the R-devel
mailing list.

216
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:06,150
R-devel mailing list is an email list for

217
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,120
people who are doing development work in
R.

218
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,710
So either they're developing packages or
they're

219
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,979
making modifications to the R source code
itself.

220
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,070
And so the subject was, you could see

221
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,430
from the subject that it's going to be a
problem.

222
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,370
The subject is large data set dash
confused.

223
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,385
So right away that much information

224
00:11:22,385 --> 00:11:25,220
here to go on.
It's not clear what the problem is.

225
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,660
And the message just says I'm trying to
load

226
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,080
a data set into R, but I'm completely
lost.

227
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,290
This is probably due to, mostly to the
fact that I'm on

228
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,950
a complete R noob, but it's got me stuck
in a research project.

229
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,100
So you have to ask yourself, what do I

230
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,530
know about this persons problem from
reading this message?

231
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,570
And the truth is very little.

232
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,740
And so the response was somewhat
predictable.

233
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,420
Basically the

234
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,710
first person response said, yes you are
lost.

235
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,140
And then there is a pointer to the posting
guide

236
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:57,110
which everyone should read before sending
email through the mailing list.

237
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,190
And then also a list of manuals.

238
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,730
And so, here you can see that one round of
email was immediately

239
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,850
wasted because probably the answer to the
question was in one of the manuals.

240
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:12,540
And so, and the user didn't specify
whether he or she had already done that.

241
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,170
So, in terms of what went wrong with this
little exchange, first

242
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,610
of course the question was sent to simply
the wrong mailing list.

243
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,420
The R-devel mailing list is for

244
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,130
development questions and for more
sophisticated programmers.

245
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,930
It's not really mailing list for questions
as this person stated noobs.

246
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,664
So that question really should have gone
to the R

247
00:12:30,664 --> 00:12:33,820
help mailing list where it would have been
better received.

248
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,000
However, in addition to that, the email
subject was very vague.

249
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,560
It was not clear

250
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,040
what the problem was.
The question itself was very vague.

251
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,760
There was no reproducible example there.

252
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,230
There was nothing, there's not possible
for other people who

253
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,600
were reading the e-mail to reproduce what
that person's problem was.

254
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,000
And further, and there was no evidence
that

255
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,170
any effort was made to solve the problem.

256
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,830
So there's no evidence that they searched
the web or checked the manuals or

257
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,180
or experimented with the problem or
anything

258
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,578
like that or even looked at the forums.

259
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:02,610
So the end result was a complete recipe
for

260
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,230
disaster and there were, it was likely
that this

261
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,520
person did not get the answer to their
question.

262
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,810
So, a couple places to turn for this
course, first

263
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,440
of all the class discussion board I think
will be the

264
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,190
most useful because your fellow students
can help you out

265
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,240
there and I can respond to you on the
discussion board.

266
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,070
Outside of class there's the R help
mailing list which I just described.

267
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,350
And you can post to this mailing list as
long, and it's useful to

268
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,480
of course follow all the rules that we
talked about just now a bit.

269
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,810
And depending on what other projects you

270
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,710
might be working on there are other
project-specific

271
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,060
mailing lists for other types of software.

272
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,710
And so this talk was inspired by Eric
Raymond's

273
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,620
posting called How to ask questions the
smart way.

274
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,250
And I encourage you to read that.

275
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,170
It's much longer.
It has a lot of other useful tips.
